# IMA Medical Ethics Minisite

## What this is
Single-page minisite analyzing the Israeli Child Psychiatry Association's 2023 response to the Ministry of Health's gender-affirming care draft circular. Shows how ideology has infiltrated medical ethics.

**Title**: "חקרנית וללא אג'נדה" (Exploratory and Without Agenda)
**Key line**: Doctors don't write "without agenda" in clinical guidelines unless they're witnessing one.
